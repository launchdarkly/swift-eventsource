# LDSwiftEventSource

Swift EventSource implementation originally written to replace a [LaunchDarkly fork](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ios-eventsource) of an [Objective-C implementation](https://github.com/neilco/ios-eventsource) for use in the [LaunchDarkly iOS (Swift) SDK](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ios-client-sdk).
