Build instructions
------------------

### Prerequisites

This library is built with [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or [SwiftPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/). The [CI build](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/swift-eventsource) builds and tests various configurations of the library on various systems, platforms, and devices. For details, see [the CircleCI configuration][ci-config].

### Building And Testing

This library can be built directly with the Swift package manager, or through XCode. To build and run tests using SwiftPM simply:

```bash
swift test
```

Or in XCode, simply select the desired target and select `Product -> Test`.

For building on the command line with `xcodebuild`, see the [continuous integration build configuration][ci-config] for examples on building and running tests.

### Running contract tests

To run the standardized contract tests that are run against all LaunchDarkly SSE client implementations:
```
make contract-tests
```

### Generating API documentation

Docs are built with [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy), which is configured [here](https://github.com/launchdarkly/swift-eventsource/blob/main/.jazzy.yaml). To build them, simply run `jazzy`. Pull requests should keep our documentation coverage at 100%.
